Run the following command in the folder with the file analyze-centrality.py with correct path to edgelist file:

$ python analyze-centrality.py <path/to/edgelist> [-plt [-log]| path/to/names/list]

1. Run the following to generate the output files.
$ python analyze-centrality.py <path/to/edgelist>

2. After executing step 1, the optional parameters can be used. When using the parameters, it code will use the
   output data from step 1 and hence avoids lengthy computation time. Note that the path to edgelist must still be
   provided as the file names will be calculated based on that name.

   Option descriptions::
   a. -plt => Generates the centrality-rank plots.
   b. -plt -log => Generates the log(centrality)-log(rank) plots.
   c> path/to/name/list => Providing both the edgelist and namelist as parameter generates the top 10 entries by
      centrality.

      Note: The format in the .name files are inconsistent (some have the names withing quotes and some have the names only
      separated by space). Please use the appropriate method to split the line manually (mentioned as comments in
      the function get_top_entities_from_file() )
